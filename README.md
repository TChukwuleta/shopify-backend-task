# shopify-backend-task

This is my code entry for the Shopify 2022 Backend Intership

For this I built a basic front end to test the functionality of the task. So you can test it online and also locally. To test it online click the following link:
[Image Repository](https://shopify-tobe-image-repo.herokuapp.com/)

To run the code locally:
1. `git clone https://github.com/TChukwuleta/shopify-backend-task`
2. change directory to where the code is stored
3. Open the terminal on that directory and enter `npm install` to instal all required dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the server locally


##  Scope of the project

This is a secure photo repository for users where users can:
- Upload one photo at a time
- Delete one photo at a time
- Get a list of all their photos

##  Testing

Tests are run using the `mocha` framework. This is stored in the `/tests` folder.

Here is an output photo of the test:
